[00:10.69] I let you down
[00:14.98] Let me pick you up
[00:18.07] I let you down
[00:21.25] Let me climb up you to the top
[00:24.60] So I can see the view from up there
[00:31.33] Tangled in your hair
[00:36.44] I let you down
[00:43.44] 
[00:41.66] I have no lid upon my head
[00:45.19] But if I did
[00:47.28] You could look inside and see what's on my mind
[00:52.50] You could look inside and see what's on my mind
[01:16.00] 
[00:59.29] I let you down, oh, forgive me
[01:05.36] You give me love
[01:10.04] Let me walk with you, maybe I could say
[01:14.19] Maybe talk with you, open up
[01:17.79] And let me through
[01:26.79] 
[01:19.23] Don't walk away
[01:25.40] Don't walk away
[01:32.90] 
[01:32.26] I have no lid upon my head
[01:35.89] But if I did
[01:37.97] You could look inside and see what's on my mind
[01:43.19] You could look inside and see what's on my mind
[02:06.69] 
[01:49.54] I let you down
[01:52.70] How could I be such a fool like me?
[02:00.21] I let you down
[02:03.39] Tail between my legs
[02:08.61] I'm a puppy for your love
[02:14.12] I'm a puppy for your love
[02:26.62] 
[02:20.70] I have no lid upon my head
[02:24.33] But if I did
[02:26.66] You could look inside and see what's on my mind, oh it's you
[02:56.66] 
[02:38.10] I let you down
[02:42.02] I'm a puppy for your love
[02:47.12] I'm a puppy for your love
[02:53.75] Forgive me
[02:56.82] Forgive me
[03:03.16] Forgive me
[03:10.20] I let you down
