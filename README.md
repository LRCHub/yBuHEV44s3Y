# Dawid Podsiadło – Let You Down

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Feel the rhythm of the streets
Neon lights and neon dreams
Bloody fists they feel no pain
When there's so much
more to gain
Hunting season if you will
Tell me where you'd rather be
I can hardly see the moon
Hope we'll get there pretty soon
Trying so hard to release
You out of the misery
Hold on to your wishes
If you can't hold on to me
Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down
again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now
They will finally
feel the flames
Flames that run down
through my veins
I will make the city burn
We're not planning to return
Trying so hard to be free
To make you see what I see
Hold on to your wishes
If you can't hold on to me
Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down
again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now
Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down
again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now
Oh my love
Love
Love
Oh let you down
Oh let you down
Let you down
Oh let you down
